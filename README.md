# Handwritten-digit-recognition-using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
Handwritten digit recognition using KNN is a pattern recognition technique that classifies hand-drawn digits by comparing them to labeled examples in the dataset. KNN determines the digit class of a test image by identifying the K nearest training examples and assigning the class that occurs most frequently among these neighbors.
